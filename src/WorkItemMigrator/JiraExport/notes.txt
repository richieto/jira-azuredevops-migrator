Important differences

In Jira, features are not used. No problem to migration
In Jira, Task and Technical tasks seem to be the same, treat as new "Technical Task"
In Jira, some Tasks should be actually Stories, others should be sub-tasks of a single item.

-Engineering  (not directly releted to a product feature, previous technical task)
-Improvement
-Assignment (Task in Jira, not directly related to a product feature and limited scope)
-
